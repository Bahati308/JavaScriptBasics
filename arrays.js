// an array is a collection of
// different values and can be of different data types

// we examine 2 ways to create arrays 

let arrylength = 5;

let arr1 = [];// first method
let arr2 = Array(arrylength); //2nd method

// let arr2 = Array(5); this is also possible

console.log(arr1.length);
console.log(arr2.length);
